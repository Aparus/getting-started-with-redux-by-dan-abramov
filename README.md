# React / Redax ToDo application 
My way through tutorial ["Getting started with Redux"](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree) by Dan Abramov. 

[![Redux](https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/series/square_covers/000/000/025/thumb/EGH_Redux-New.png?1496436379)](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree)

Realization on the top of react-create-app boilerplate, with Jest testing instead of "michael jackson tests", explained in tutorial.

Finally I refactored all the code, separated 1 file from Dan's tutorial to several React-Components, Redax: actions, reducers and store. And deleted all learning things (like Counter) except final ToDoApp.

I highly recommend use [Redux dev tool for Chrome browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=ru) and [Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for create starter project with preconfigured lots of useful things (like Jest unit testing, dev-server with hot reload, Webpack bundling, watching changes etc).
